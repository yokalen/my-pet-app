# My Pet App
My Pets is a full-stack platform that allows users to create profiles for their pets. Users can upload photographs of their pets and provide detailed information about their pets' age, breed, and other attributes. The application uses an MVC architecture, with Node.js and Express on the back-end and MongoDB for data storage. Image upload is facilitated using Multer, and the UI is designed using Bootstrap. In addition to these features, I plan to integrate Fabric.js for image editing, as well as a vaccine record upload functionality.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, EJS

I built a full-stack web application using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture pattern. For the server-side programming, I chose Node.js with Express and for the database, I utilized MongoDB. To enable image upload functionality, I integrated Multer into my application. Additionally, I used Bootstrap and EJS for the user interface.

The MVC pattern allowed me to effectively separate my application's data, user interface, and control logic into three separate components: models, views, and controllers. By using Node.js with Express, I was able to develop a lightweight and flexible server-side framework that allowed me to quickly build my web application. MongoDB, on the other hand, offered a flexible and scalable NoSQL database that can store large amounts of data.

Multer was a useful middleware that allowed me to handle file uploads in my Node.js application. This feature was particularly important for my web application, as it required users to upload images or other files.

To ensure a visually appealing and easy-to-use user interface, I chose to use Bootstrap. Its pre-designed UI components and styles enabled me to create a robust user experience for my web application.

Overall, I am proud of what I accomplished with this project. Not only did I successfully implement several key technologies and frameworks, but I also developed a thorough understanding of the MVC architecture pattern. I am confident that these skills will be invaluable as I pursue a career in web development.

## Optimizations

There are several optimizations that I would like to implement in my web application to make it even better. One of the main features I would like to add is the ability for users to edit their pet photographs after they upload them. To achieve this, I plan to integrate Fabric.js, a powerful and flexible Javascript library for manipulating images, into my application. This will allow users to crop, resize, and edit their pet photographs to create the perfect sized avatar.

In addition, I would like to improve the pet description section of my application. Specifically, I plan to use the user-inputted data to create a more detailed pet description, including the age calculated from the birthday. This will provide users with a more accurate representation of their pets' attributes and characteristics.

Another feature I plan to add is the ability for users to upload and share their pets' vaccine records. To accomplish this, I will integrate a file upload component into my application, allowing users to upload and store their pets' vaccine records securely. Additionally, I will add two buttons that correspond to vaccine records and veterinary records sections on the pet page. This will make it easier for users to view and manage their pets' important medical information.

Overall, I am excited about these optimizations and believe they will greatly enhance the user experience of my web application. By integrating Fabric.js, improving the pet description section, and adding vaccine record functionality, I will be able to provide users with even more tools to manage and care for their pets.

## Lessons Learned:

Building this web application was a challenging but rewarding experience for me. It is the largest and most robust web application that I have built to date, and I learned a lot throughout the development process.

One of my biggest accomplishments was successfully implementing the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture, making it easier to manage and maintain the codebase. Additionally, I was able to successfully integrate several key technologies and frameworks, including Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Multer, and Bootstrap.

Another important lesson I learned while building this application was the importance of thorough planning and organization. Before starting the development process, I spent a significant amount of time outlining my project's requirements, creating a wireframe, and breaking down the tasks into manageable steps. This helped me stay on track and ensure that my application was meeting all of my original objectives.

Finally, I learned that building web applications is an iterative process. Throughout development, I made many small tweaks and adjustments to the code, constantly refining and improving the application.

Overall, I am thrilled with what I was able to accomplish with this web application, and I am excited to build even more and better applications in the future.
