I want to use the cover-pets img as a background image for the index page and login page where the content of the page is shifted right 

had a error created a new account because earlier i removed the username field. adding it back in - controller, model, signup page

fixed. demo creds: demo@kipod.us, demo

login => page with all pets, see wireframe drawings - link to logout, each pet is a link to pet page with their specific info

    would be cool to have sound effects to associate with animals

Before first pet is added, page with all pets is just a circle with a plus sign in the middle. Links to add pet form.

future functionality: allow for co-owned pets. be able to share pet with others, i will see pets shared with me under pets, after my own pets

building out profile view - see drawing

add a pet functionality - it shouldn't be createPet path, new route /pets/addPet that renders ejs  - add pet form
